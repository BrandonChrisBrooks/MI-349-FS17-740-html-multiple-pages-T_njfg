  <h1>What Are my Favorite Pets?</h1>
  <p>
  I just want to share with you all my three
  favorite kinds of pets. If you want to know
  which animals they are and why I chose them
  head over to the list page. They will fully
  explain my flawless why these pets are without
  equal. Anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
  Especially Susan.
