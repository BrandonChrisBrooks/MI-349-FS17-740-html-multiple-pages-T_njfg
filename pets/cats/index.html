  Woah there! A little stressed are we? Maybe you should get a cat.
  Yes that's right, I said get a cat! The sounds of a cat's purr
  can lower your blood pressure. Oh but you want someone who can
  play fetch? Cats can do it too! They are very easy to housebreak
  so you don't have to spend weeks potty training another mammal.
  You can bring your cat with you!!! Going on a trip? Grab the cat
  and the cat carrier and be on your way. You don't have to put your
  pet for a million (billion) dollars for someone who is going to
  put your cat in a cage anyways. Do it yourself, have the comfort
  of your cat, and save money! Cats are the best!
