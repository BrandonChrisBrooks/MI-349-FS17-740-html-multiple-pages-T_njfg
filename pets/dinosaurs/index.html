  You might be thinking I'm crazy. Susan told you that didn't she?
  She's wrong! Dinosaurs make great pets. First and most importantly
  they're intimidating. Have you ever head of anyone getting robbed
  who owned a dinosaur? Exactly. Late to work? Hop on your dinosaur
  and skip the traffic. Dinosaurs pretty much are the ideal pets.
